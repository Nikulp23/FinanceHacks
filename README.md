## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and npm**: Make sure Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your system.

2. **API Keys**: Place your API keys in the appropriate configuration files within the project. These files are typically located in the directories of the `frontend` and `backend` parts of the project.

### Running the Project

To run the FinanceHacks project, you will need to start both the frontend and the backend services. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and follow these steps:

1. **Start the Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
     ```
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install the necessary dependencies (only needed the first time):
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend application:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - This will serve the frontend on a local web server, usually accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

2. **Start the Backend**:
   - Open a new terminal tab or window and navigate to the `backend` directory:
     ```
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install the necessary dependencies (if you haven't already):
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the backend service:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - The backend service will start, and it will be listening for requests from the frontend.
     backend is accessible at [http://localhost:8080]
